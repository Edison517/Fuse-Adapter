# Fuse-Adapter
Fuse Adapter converts "torpedo"-shape fuses to stand mini-blade style fuses for older (European) vehicles

I used to have a 1993 Volvo 240, and the fuses in this car are a "torpedo"-shape; which are impossible (for me) to find locally. So I had to order a pack from an online store, but then I have to wait to get them. This small pcba simply converts the style of fuse into something much more common and available, the mini-blade fuse.

This torpedo fuse is also used in many other (mostly European?) vehicles from the late 90s, give or take a decade(?), so they should be useable in many other vehicles.

Obviously the shape is different, so in order to get these to fit in the original space, this fuse adapter needs to be rotated so the mini-blade fuse sort of overlaps the fuse next to it...Not great, however, it does make it easy to see if the fuse is good or bad.

One thing to keep in mind, the torpedo fuses came in amp ratings of 3, 5, 7.5, 10, 16, 25 (?); mini-blade fuses come in ratings of 2, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. So sometimes there will not be an exact replacement.

** I recommend replacing the fuse with the next lower available fuse! But if you start popping that fuse, you may want to try the next higher rating, with the knowledge that the fuse MAY NOT BE THE WEAKEST LINK in the circuit anymore! **

You'll need to order the pcbs with the included gerbers, and order the mini-blade fuse holders from your favorite distributor. Then simply solder the fuse holders to the pcb, clean the connections, and insert the fuse of your choice, and install it as-needed!

The pcbs should be standard thickness, 1.6mm (0.062"), and make sure to tell the board fab house to edge-plate both ends where the copper is exposed on top and bottom, using 2oz of copper on top and bottom (very important!). I used PCBWAY.com and I was very happy with the results.
